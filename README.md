# Bersih.Kan-Capstone
Bersih.Kan: A Comprehensive Platform for Efficient Waste Management Solutions

Coming from different hometowns, our team was personally touched by the waste-related challenges we encountered â€“ from landfill closures to city inconveniences, flooding, and polluted rivers. We also witnessed the efforts of waste pickers trying to make a living. These experiences fueled our shared concern and inspired us to create a solution: a waste management app that connects those with expertise in waste management to those in need of disposal, promoting sustainability and addressing these pressing issues.
